- Automatic notification dispatch based on threat levels.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Image:** Farmers upload a crop image via the web or mobile app.
2. **AI Analysis:** The system detects plant diseases, pests, or nutrient deficiencies.
3. **Diagnosis & Recommendations:** AI suggests treatments based on analysis results.
4. **Mapping & Alerts:** Farmers receive updates on potential outbreaks in their area.
5. **Community Engagement:** Farmers can share insights and discuss findings.

## Key Benefits

- **Early Disease Detection**: Reduces crop loss and increases yield.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Helps optimize farming decisions.
- **Community Awareness**: Farmers stay informed on regional threats.
- **Scalable Solution**: Works for small farms to large agricultural enterprises.
- **Cost-Effective**: Provides an affordable alternative to manual inspections.

## Google Cloud Technologies Used

- **Google AI Studio**: Gemini API for AI-based insights and building core features
- **Google Maps API**: for visualization & outbreak tracking
- **Firebase & Firestore**: for authentication & real-time data storage

By leveraging AI, cloud computing, and real-time mapping, FarmerPal helps farmers make informed decisions, reduce losses, and ensure sustainable agricultural practices. üåæüöú

## Application Details

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
